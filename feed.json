            "summary": "It is conceivable that developers constantly update their Cadence workflow code based upon new business use cases and needs. However,\nthe definition of a Cadence workflow must be deterministic because behind the scenes cadence uses event sourcing to construct\nthe workflow state by replaying the historical events stored for this specific workflow. Introducing components that are not compatible\nwith an existing running workflow will yield to non-deterministic errors and sometimes developers find it tricky to debug. Consider the\nfollowing workflow that executes two activities.\n\nfunc SampleWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, data string) (string, error) {\n    ao := workflow.ActivityOptions{\n        ScheduleToStartTimeout: time.Minute,\n        StartToCloseTimeout:    time.Minute,\n    }\n    ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, ao)\n    var result1 string\n    err := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityA, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\n    if err != nil {\n        return \"\", err\n    }\n    v ...",
